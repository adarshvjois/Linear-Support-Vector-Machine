# Linear-Support-Vector-Machine
Linear SVM that uses Pegasos, with sparse vectors. There also exists a sparse vector implementation with this project.

Uses the sparse vector implementation provided with pegasos.py.

Usage with your code:

*1) Create a list of counting_sparse_vectors and a corresponding list of training labels.
*2) Pass this list to pegasos to train the svm, with parameters you see fit.
*3) You can use the other utility functions provided with the pegasos implementation by tweaking them as you see fit.

Don't forget to say thanks. Or buy me a beer.
